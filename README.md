# JAD3
Medicine WHoman

Here is the basic template for JAD3. JAD3 will be our health and wellness app that will be developed by STILLearning S. F. 
We will store basic info about the user, like name, birth date, and email address. 

If the user desires, they can opt into data tracking.
This allows the app access to the health data collected by smart watch. 

We will also implement a midJourney like api that will allow the user to take a picture of thier food, and the model will figure out the molecular makeup of the food, and input it into a database.

The goal of JAD3 is to achive total heal data, and feed it into our model to better understand the optimal diet of humanity.

We can then partner this tech with the government to implement a food scholarship, where individuals can apply, and STILLiving Factories will ship the good food to the person. Free of charge. All you have to do is put in your address. If you want to cancel, you can cancel.

The idea is giving the world free high quality food... if they want it.

First we need to do some data tracking to understand the optimal diet of our species.

Once we undersstand the basic principles, we can then fine tune it for each individual human, and update
the model in real time with food tracking and biologial tracking in wearable tech.
